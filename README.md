I'm a Software Engineer scaling small services to large audiences.  

Projects on my public github are typically just hobby projects built for self learning.

I'm super passionate about
- retro tech and aesthetics
- game design
- highly interactive UX and easy to read UIs
- art

If you're looking for help on a project of your own, I'd love to collaborate by

- providing programming for games written for Godot
- providing Art or Programming for visual novels
- creating reactive experiences for streamer/vtuber overlays
