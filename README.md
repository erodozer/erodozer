I'm a Senior Software Engineer scaling small services to large audiences.  

_Projects on my public github are typically just hobby projects built for self learning, unassociated with any employment_

I'm extra passionate about  

💽 - retro tech and aesthetics  
🕹️ - game design  
🐕 - highly interactive UX and easy to read UIs  
🎨 - art  

If you're looking for help on a project of your own, I'd love to collaborate by

- providing programming for games written for Godot
- drawing concept art and full screen illustrations
- creating reactive experiences for streamer/vtuber overlays

You can sponsor my independent work through Ko-fi
